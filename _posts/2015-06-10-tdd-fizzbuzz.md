title: TDD FizzBuzz 
---

So after [automating the AP Computer Science exam](LAST POST), the question is 
hanging in the air

Should AP Computer Science cover TDD?
-------------------------------------

Dropping any politicizing acronyms, lets ask ‘should APCS teach automated 
testing?’  I’m going with yes.  So how to do it?

The FizzBuzz lesson
-------------------

The learning target here is building the schema of test-first.
Students should come out able to describe how software can test software. Bonus 
points if they can tell you what “everything that could break” means[FOOTNOTE]
(Interestingly, this is the only mention of testing I’ve yet found in the APCS
materials: a MC question on the dogma of “*there could always be more bugs!*”).

This lesson relies on the teacher’s skill in steering the discussion.  It’s a 
coding demostration, but if I learned one thing in my first year of teaching 
this course it’s how to survive a coding demonstration. There’s a way of 
distilling a complex group discussion into a plan that just happens to line up
with what you were going to do anyway. Don’t do that. Rather go in with a clear 
understanding of the key moments in the lesson and make sure you visit them.
All this is to say that the code in this lesson could have turned out any
number of ways.

The Essential Question
----------------------

How do we know that a piece of software “works”?
